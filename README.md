## Project description

I made this game primarily to study Redux and Error handling. Although it has some code smells, it is generally well made, and more importantly for a game: has great time sessions and replay rate. Key features include:

- Rudimentar AI balancement
- Redux for state management
- Errors for triggers
- Modular architecture of piece and blocks
- Pseudo 3d visuals and VFX
